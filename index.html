    <h2>Part 1: Does Frequency of Voting Change With Income and Education?</h2>
    <iframe src = 'images/categories.html' width="100%" height="100%" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
    <p>This plot explores the relationship between voting frequency, income, and education.</p>
    <br>
    <p>There appears to be a correlation between education level, income, and voting frequency. The more education and income a person has, the more likely they are to vote more frequently. This is shown by the “High School or Less” and “Less Than $40k” categories as they have the largest proportions of their populations going to the “Rarely/Never” category. Additionally, moving up either side of the parallel categories plot will show an increase in “Always” responses as the respondents become more highly educated and wealthy. The strongest correlation appears to be between education and voting frequency, however, as the percentage of those who vote “Always” increases dramatically with each increase in education level.
        Also, there appears to be a relationship between income and education as the more educated a person is the more likely they are to have higher income. This is demonstrated by the line going from “College” level education to “$125k or More” level income is almost the thickest on the entire graph. Additionally, by hovering over the “College” level education, the reader can see that the majority of the lines connect to the higher two levels of income.
