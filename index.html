        <summary><h2><span style="background-color:#FFFF00">Part 1:</span> Does Frequency of Voting Change With Income and Education?</h2></summary>
        <iframe src = 'images/categories.html' width="1000" height="600" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
        <p>This plot explores the relationship between voting frequency, income, and education.</p>
    <br>
    <p>There appears to be a correlation between education level, income, and voting frequency. The more education and income a person has, the more likely they are to vote more frequently. This is shown by the “High School or Less” and “Less Than $40k” categories as they have the largest proportions of their populations going to the “Rarely/Never” category. Additionally, moving up either side of the parallel categories plot will show an increase in “Always” responses as the respondents become more highly educated and wealthy. The strongest correlation appears to be between education and voting frequency, however, as the percentage of those who vote “Always” increases dramatically with each increase in education level.
        Also, there appears to be a relationship between income and education as the more educated a person is the more likely they are to have higher income. This is demonstrated by the line going from “College” level education to “$125k or More” level income is almost the thickest on the entire graph. Additionally, by hovering over the “College” level education, the reader can see that the majority of the lines connect to the higher two levels of income.

        <summary><h2><span style="background-color:#FFFF00">Part 2:</span> How did Voter Turnout and Absentee Voting Change in the Virginia General Elections From 2014 to 2022?</h2></summary>
        <iframe src = 'images/bubble.html' width = "1000" height = "800" frameBorder = "0"></iframe>
    <p>This plot explores the relationship between voter turnout and absentee voting.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The year 2020 looks particularly different from others on this plot. It is different in that the absentee ballot percentage is much higher across the board. This is demonstrated by nearly every point on the graph taking on a much greater Y value. This is likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is easier for the viewer to see the differences in the years with the animation as it emphasizes the large shift in absentee ballot percentage when the reader sees the data shift upward so much. 
        It also appears that, during the years 2016 and 2020, there was a noticeable increase in voter turnout percentage. This is likely due to the increased importance of the presidential election and thus more people went out to vote.

        <summary><h2><span style="background-color:#FFFF00">Part 3:</span> What did Voter Turnout Look Like in Cities and Counties in Virginia in the 2022 General Election?</h2></summary>
        <iframe src = 'images/map.html' width = "1000" height = "750" frameBorder = "0"></iframe>
    <p>This plot explores the relationship between voter turnout and location across Virginia.</p>
    <br>
    <p>There appear to be a few trends in voter turnout that are revealed by the map. Interestingly, voter turnout tends to increase in the more eastern counties and cities and decrease in the west. In fact, the lowest voter turnout percentage counties are all next to each other in the far west of the state. Also, counties appear to average higher voting turnout than cities. Finally, another trend is that the areas surrounding Washington D.C. appear to have a higher voting turnout than average.
